## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Guide


### üöÄ VPN Server (192.168.9.11) Commands

1. **Enable IP Forwarding**
    ```bash
    sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
    echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
    sudo sysctl -p
    ```
2. **Configure Firewall Rules (iptables)**
    ```bash
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3000 -j ACCEPT  # Allow VPN connection port
    sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i tun0 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT    # Allow VPN traffic
    sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o tun0 -j ACCEPT
    sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE  # NAT for external traffic
    sudo iptables-save | sudo tee /etc/iptables.rules  # Save rules
    ```
    To persist firewall rules on reboot:
    ```bash
    sudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.rules
    ```
3. **Bring Up the TUN Interface**
    ```bash
    ip link set tun0 up
    ip addr add 192.168.9.11/24 dev tun0
    ```

### üíª VPN Client (192.168.9.9) Commands

1. **Allow VPN Traffic**
    ```bash
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -i tun0 -j ACCEPT
    sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i tun0 -j ACCEPT
    ```
2. **Route Traffic Through VPN** (to be done after running the client binary)
    ```bash
    sudo ip route add default via 192.168.9.11 dev tun0
    ```

## üîÑ How It Works

1. **Registration:**
   - **Clients:**  
     Sign up, subscribe, and select VPN endpoints from a global network.
   - **Nodes:**  
     Register on the Ethereum blockchain by staking the required fee, then start providing VPN services.

2. **Transaction Flow:**
   - **Clients** pay their subscription fees through the Ethereum network.
   - **Nodes** earn a share of these fees in **ETH tokens**, with a portion deducted as commission.

3. **Incentives:**
   - **Earn ETH Tokens:**  
     Rewarding nodes for consistent, high-quality service.
   - **Secure the Network:**  
     The staking mechanism deters malicious behavior and ensures a stable, high-performance ecosystem.

## üí° Benefits

- **Enhanced Privacy:**  
  Rely less on centralized providers and more on a secure, decentralized network.

- **User Empowerment:**  
  Whether you‚Äôre a client or a node, you play a vital role in maintaining and benefiting from the ecosystem.

- **Transparent Ecosystem:**  
  Every transaction is secure, transparent, and verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain.
